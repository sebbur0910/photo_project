May just save file into project files, store filepath in database, use PIL
Store systematically incremented local filepath (eg {timeline}/image{number})
ram/ storage / efficiency worries?

^takes the filepath as argument

^takes the blob, need to use the IO module

we will use blob: much better practice

need to fix route around the application, particularily in going from upload photo back to customise timeline, etc

prefills for customise timeline (using entry box insert method)
new timeline saved intermediate as timeline_id = 999 (or some other large number)
then allows for same prefill mechanism

getting the timeline name is returning nothing (demonstrated by goooooooooooob and then \n s)

do an aggregation query
