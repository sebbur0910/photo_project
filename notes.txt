May just save file into project files, store filepath in database, use PIL
Store systematically incremented local filepath (eg {timeline}/image{number})
ram/ storage / efficiency worries?

^takes the filepath as argument

^takes the blob, need to use the IO module

we will use blob: much better practice

need to fix route around the application, particularily in going from upload photo back to customise timeline, etc

prefills for customise timeline (using entry box insert method)
new timeline saved intermediate as timeline_id = 999 (or some other large number)
then allows for same prefill mechanism

getting the timeline name is returning nothing (demonstrated by goooooooooooob and then \n s)

do an aggregation query

when it pastes the date taken i need to put it back in a friendly format

needs to make sure that it doesn't run into an error trying to sort no timelines

Do validation
need tp exc;ude 999 from thumbnail place
getting an odd sql error: doesn't like the way im modifying the primary key whilst searching by it?

delete toggle in the view/delete current

have to change show_frame because as it is it runs all the __init__()s. very bad, very slow

something is wrong with the date taken validation

for eval: reduce runtime by reducing database queries and processing (e.g. not creating new thumbnails every single time)

timeline sorting broken?
