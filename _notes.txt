May just save file into project files, store filepath in database, use PIL
Store systematically incremented local filepath (eg {timeline}/image{number})
ram/ storage / efficiency worries?

^takes the filepath as argument

^takes the blob, need to use the IO module

we will use blob: much better practice

need to fix route around the application, particularily in going from upload photo back to customise timeline, etc

prefills for customise timeline (using entry box insert method)
new timeline saved intermediate as timeline_id = 999 (or some other large number)
then allows for same prefill mechanism

getting the timeline name is returning nothing (demonstrated by goooooooooooob and then \n s)

do an aggregation query

when it pastes the date taken i need to put it back in a friendly format

needs to make sure that it doesn't run into an error trying to sort no timelines

Do validation
need tp exc;ude 999 from thumbnail place
getting an odd sql error: doesn't like the way im modifying the primary key whilst searching by it?

delete toggle in the view/delete current

have to change show_frame because as it is it runs all the __init__()s. very bad, very slow

something is wrong with the date taken validation

for eval: reduce runtime by reducing database queries and processing (e.g. not creating new thumbnails every single time)

timeline sorting broken?

when sorting photos that are in a certain timeline, need to create a join sql query which joins timeline_photos to photos and then sorts by timeline id and then orders by the factor
vut how do i query a table?
Session.query(Base.metadata.tables['myTable']).all()
defuats need to be made
i think still problem with timeline 999 nad its photos

on laptop winfo_screenheight and width give wrong values: work when whacked back into resize manager, but not for placing widgets.
works for image gallery but not canvas or homescreen??
can't zoom multiple times: combobox does not return.

cannot add tags to uncreated photo
date doesn't work with pre 2000?
-see ed sheeran timeline
its giving me too many months and dates too frequenctly

description is not grabbed from metadata because it is less standardised and users will very rarely add a decription in their file explorer.

background photo for timeline deemed inessential: would look ugly and distract from the actual photos

default border colour and default border weight?
also deemed non-essential?
